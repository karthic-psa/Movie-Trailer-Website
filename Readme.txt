1.) Open the ent.py (python) file using the IDLE editor.
2.) Go to the Run drop down menu and click on the Run option or just     press the 'F5' key.
This should run the program and open the 'Movie Trailers' website in your default web browser.

=> The other way to run the file directly is just by doble clicking (opening) the ent.py file or the fresh_tomatoes.html file. This should directly open the 'Movie Trailers' site in the browser.
