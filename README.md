# Movie Trailer Website #
A website that shows specific Movie Trailers. Server-side code written in **Python** to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. This data is then served to a web page using **HTML** and **CSS** allowing visitors to review these movies and watch the trailers.

## Instructions to run the web application ##
1. Clone the repo or download the zip.
2. Open the ```ent.py``` (python) file using the IDLE editor.
3. Go to the Run drop down menu and click on the Run option or just press the 'F5' key.
*This should run the program and open the 'Movie Trailers' website in your default web browser.*

1. **The other way to run** the file directly is just by doble clicking (opening) the ```ent.py``` file or the ```fresh_tomatoes.html``` file. This should directly open the **Movie Trailers** site in the browser.

**or**

To locally host it on your machine, implement the following:
1. Open Google Cloud SDK Shell
2. Run the command "dev_appserver.py app.yaml"
3. Open your Web browser and go to "http://localhost:8080/karthic-tomatoes"
